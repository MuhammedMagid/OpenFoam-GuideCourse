# Welcome to the OpenFOAM Course

## About the Course

This course is designed for anyone interested in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and OpenFOAM—a powerful, open-source tool widely used in the field. The best part? The course is available for free on YouTube, making it accessible to everyone eager to expand their skills in scientific computing.

By the end of this course, you’ll learn:
- What OpenFOAM is and why it’s essential for engineers and scientists.
- The structure of OpenFOAM’s source code.
- How to start your own CFD project using OpenFOAM.

## Why OpenFOAM?

Learning OpenFOAM isn’t just about using a tool; it’s about understanding CFD at a deeper level. Unlike black-box software with automated processes, OpenFOAM gives you control over every step, helping you understand the tools and why they work the way they do.

This course emphasizes a hands-on approach: working with a terminal and text editor to interact directly with OpenFOAM’s core functionality. While it requires effort, the results are rewarding.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into four segments:

1. **Segment 1:** Installation and Basics
    - Installing OpenFOAM’s source code.
    - Understanding OpenFOAM’s general structure and cases.
    - Running and controlling OpenFOAM cases.
   
2. **Segment 2:** Pre-processing
    - Creating computational meshes using tools like `blockMesh`.
    - Implementing different boundary conditions in OpenFOAM.
   
3. **Segment 3:** Solvers and Algorithms
    - Understanding the solvers and numerical algorithms used to solve equations.

4. **Segment 4:** Post-processing
    - Performing basic post-processing using ParaView.

It’s highly recommended to follow the course from start to finish, as the content is structured like a story with a clear progression.

## What You’ll Need

To take this course, all you need is a computer—and maybe a cup of coffee!

While not mandatory, having the following background knowledge can enhance your learning experience:
- **CFD Basics:** To understand what’s being solved and why.
- **Programming:** For exploring source code or creating custom solvers (not required for this course).
- **Linux Skills:** OpenFOAM runs on Linux, so familiarity with basic Linux commands is helpful.

If you’re not familiar with Linux, don’t worry! All the essential commands are covered in the course notes here: [LinuxNotes](https://github.com/MuhammedMagid/OpenFoam-GuideCourse/blob/main/00-LinuxNotes/README.md)

## What is OpenFOAM?

OpenFOAM stands for **Field Operation and Manipulation**. It is free, open-source software used to solve fields like velocity, pressure, or temperature. Written in C++ and based on the Finite Volume Method (FVM), OpenFOAM is a versatile tool for computational continuum mechanics.


OpenFOAM is an incredibly versatile tool, capable of simulating a wide range of physical phenomena. Here are some of the key areas it covers:

- **Incompressible Flows:** Perfect for scenarios where the fluid density remains constant.
- **Compressible Flows:** Used when density variations are significant, like in high-speed flows.
- **Turbulence:** Simulating complex, chaotic fluid motion.
- **Heat Transfer:** Modeling temperature changes and thermal conduction.
- **Chemical Reactions:** Simulating processes where substances interact to form new compounds.
- **Combustion:** Useful for scenarios involving burning fuels.
- **Multiphase Flows:** Handling interactions between different fluids or phases, like oil and water.
- **Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI):** Studying how fluids and solid structures influence each other.

This makes OpenFOAM a powerful tool for tackling a diverse range of challenges across industries and research fields!
