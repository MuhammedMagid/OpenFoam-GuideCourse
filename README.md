# OpenFoam Guide Course

# 

For years, I’ve been an advocate for free and open-source software (FOSS). About one year ago, I began using OpenFOAM to dive into the world of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Now, I want to share what I’ve learned, hoping these lessons can reach and benefit more people.

I’m not an expert in OpenFOAM—far from it. Creating these lessons is also a way for me to improve my own understanding. Teaching is a great way to learn, and I hope this journey inspires others to explore and grow with tools like OpenFOAM.
